# Glitchless Industries React App Boilerplate

This is a gently modified version of the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) framework available via NPM.

## Installation

In your terminal, enter the following commands:

1. `git clone [url]` this repository
2. `cd react-template` to enter the working directory
3. `npm install` to install dependencies 
4. `npx tailwind init -p` to create the necessary files for [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
5. `npm start` to start server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## After Installation
After your project is up and running, you'll need to manually create a `.env` file in the root directory to store all your environment variables like API keys. `.env` is added to `.gitignore` by default, but it's worth double-checking so you don't accidentally upload private API keys to a repo on Github or Gitlab.

## Roadmap

I plan on adding some standard features to this template as my needs for them arise. Including:

[ ] Firebase Auth
[ ] User Templates
[ ] Basic App Components

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
